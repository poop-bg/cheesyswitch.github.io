					<h3 class="black">About</h3>
					<p h2 class="black"> The story is set in a fictionalized representation of the United States in 1899 and follows the exploits of Chedder Morgan, an outlaw and member of the Cheese der Mouse gang, who must deal with the decline of the Wild West while attempting to survive against government forces, rival gangs, and other adversaries. The game is presented through first- and third-person perspectives, and the player may freely roam its interactive open world. Gameplay elements include shootouts, robberies, hunting, horseback riding, interacting with non-player characters, and maintaining the character's honor rating through moral choices and deeds. A bounty system governs the response of law enforcement and bounty hunters to crimes committed by the player.

						And run, run until it's done, done
						Until the sun comes up in the morning
						'Cause, baby, tonight
						The creeper's tryna steal all our stuff again (stuff again)
						Just when you think you're safe
						Overhear some hissing from right behind
						Right-right behind
						That's a nice life you have
						Shame, it's gotta end at this time, time, time
						Time-time-time-time
						Blows up
						Then your health bar drops and you could use a one-up
						Get inside, don't be tardy
						So, now you're stuck in there
						Half a heart is left, but don't die, die, die
						Die-die-die
						'Cause, baby, tonight
						The creeper's tryna steal all our stuff again

						You grab your pick, shovel, and bolt again (bolt again)
						And run, run until it's done, done
						Until the sun comes up in the morning
						'Cause, baby, tonight
						The creeper's tryna steal all our stuff again
						Dig up diamonds and craft those diamonds
						And make some armor, get it, baby
						Go and forge that like you so MLG pro
						The sword's made of diamonds, so come at me, bro, huh
						Training in your room under the torchlight
						Hone that form to get you ready for the big fight

						Look at me, look at you
						Take my revenge, that's what I'm gonna do
						I'm a warrior, baby, what else is new?
						And my blade's gonna tear through you, bring it
						'Cause, baby, tonight
						The creeper's tryna steal all our stuff again
						(Gather your stuff, yeah, let's take back the world)
						Yeah, baby, tonight
						Grab your sword, armor, and go (it's on)
						Take your revenge (whoa), oh-oh, oh-oh

						Of your life, life, show them your bite (whoa)
						'Cause, baby, tonight
						The creeper's tryna steal all our stuff again
						'Cause, baby, tonight
						You grab your pick, shovel and bolt again (bolt again)
